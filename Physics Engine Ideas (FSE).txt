2-D physics engine for testing scenarios (needs name)
Make it in Java? Def not python, and Idk if any of us wanna learn new lang
Ask Searcy about ideas???
Also show her when done ez marks
Group: Gary Leo Adam



Controls:
rate of time passing
pause button
distance scaling
where origin is (dragging?)
'directional gravity' (Directional can't coexist with internal)



Object properties:
internal gravity (i.e. planets)
elastic/non elastic collisions
friction, inclined planes
4 material objects to determine friction between objects
A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, C-D
can be shaped like circles (can roll or not), squares, or triangles
wall objects (including floor) to contain system



Set-Up:
Scenario objects (like asteroids), would help with saving attributes like shape list
All objects part of scenarios
Also Physics object inherited to other things and branches down
Store all object changes, then have method to act upon object changes
Kind of like storing vectors acting on objects per frame, then change stuff
Default: floor, directional down gravity, one circle object that falls and hits the floor, non elastic, regular time and a few meters up



Menu System:
Main Menu
-Start new scenario
-Load old scenario
-Help

Start new
-Goes straight to new scenario set up
with default settings
-Save button to place current scenario (must be paused) in saved

Load old
-Pages of saved scenarios to load up

Help
-How to use it (might need a couple pages)
-Credits button?
