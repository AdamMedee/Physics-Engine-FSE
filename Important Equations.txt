First char is identity of unit, second char is first 
or second object, third char is initial / final.

Ellastic head on collision
v1f    =    v1i * (m1 - m2) / (m1 + m2)  +  v2i * (2 * m2) / (m1 + m2)

Inelastic head on collision (R = coefficient of restitution 0 <= R <= 1)
v1f    =    v1i * (m1 - R * m2) / (m1 + m2)  +  v2i * ((1 + R) * m2) / (m1 + m2)
